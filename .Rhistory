dex <- paste("C.gigas fluorescent dextran testing 06/23/22
Purpose: To explore passive uptake of fluorescent labeled dextran in C. gigas oocytes in preparation of electroporation trials. Activities include: reconstituting and alquoting the dextran, exploring functionality of the fluorescent scope to visualize the fluorescein dye, evaluating whether or not there is passive update of the dextran, incubating embryos in 12 well plates to evaluate survival (needed for holding embryos after electroporation trials).
Materials:
C. gigas gametes (collected 06/22/22 from Pac Hybreed spawn, kept on ice/refrigerated O/N)
20um screen (for screening oocytes)
1L filtered seawater FSW
Fluorescent labeled dextran - 3000 MW fluorescein
Ultrapure water
Beakers
pipettes/tips
Glass slides
Microscope (fluorescent and inverted)
12 well plates
1.7 mL tubes
Procedure:
Oocytes from 3 females were hydrated separately  in FSW for ~ 1 hr (note: all trials were done with a single female where egg quality looked the best based on shape)
Labeled dextran preparation
Reconstituted 10mg of Dextran with 500uL ultrapure water for a concentration of 20mg/mL.  Aliquoted into 60uL aliquots and frozen back into -20 in same bag since it was light protective.
Prepared ‘salty’ working stock at 2mg/mL by adding 50uL of the 20mg/mL stock to 450uL FSW.
Dye Trials
Dye Trial 1 - oocytes and dye only
Added 100uL of oocytes (didn’t count them, but enough to see visible pellet for rinsing) and 100uL of 2mg/mL dextran to a microcentrifuge tube and incubated 20 min.
Rinsed 2x with FSW (decanting in between) and resuspended in FSW ~ 100uL
Visualized with fluorescent scope <- maybe Larken can make some notes about procedure.
Findings: a few cells, maybe not even oocytes (or possibly dead oocytes) fluoresced, but not the ooctyes. A few particles of heavy fluorescence present
Example Images:

Fluorescent
Dye Trial 2 - dye mixed with sperm and then added to oocytes
Added 100uL of sperm and 100uL of 2mg/mL dextran to microcentrifuge tube to mix
Added directly to ~300uL of oocytes
Incubated 10 min
Rinsed 2x with 100uL FSW and resuspended in ~100uL of FSW
Findings: wowza, lots of fluorescence on/in oocytes.  Difficult to say if dye is on surface of cell or inside, but definitely different than the first trial. I was concerned that fluor. might be due to long time post hydration (a few hours) and maybe they were dead cells, but some had polar bodies indicating they had fertilized.  Decided to try again with just oocytes to confirm that it wasn’t the length of time post-hydration that caused the florescence.

Dye Trial 3 - dye mixed with oocytes
This trial was right after trial 2 and did the same steps as Dye Trial 2, but used 100uL of FSW instead of sperm to confirm that the presence of sperm induced the fluor. On the oocytes from that trial
Findings: no fluor. On oocytes, similar to dye trial 1.  Confirmed that fluor. From dye trial 2 was the result of sperm presence.

Embryo plating
Fertilized oocytes with 400uL of sperm (initially added 100uL to sperm and ~1 sperm/egg so added an additional 300 uL)
Observed polar body formation and first cell divisions
Counted embryos ~ 4 cell stage and plated them
Added 10uL of embryo to slide and counted 2x = 8.4 embryos/uL
Plated different concentrations of embryos (added 500, 1000, 5000 and 10,000 embryos per well in triplicate and volumed up to 1, 2 or 4 mL)
Visualized on inverted scope.  All embryos were monolayer, but 10k looked a bit dense.
Placed in RT incubator in corner lab ~23C
Results:
Olivia checked oysters after 24hr (ish).  Her notes: Okay 12-well plate report: I found alive cells in all the wells. There was a lot of unfertilized eggs sitting at the bottom of the higher concentration wells but overall they look pretty happy. 2mL/10,000 had the worst ratio of alive/dead and 1mL/5000 had the best
I checked oysters after 48 hrs: thermometer read 24C. Live oysters present in all wells mostly at D-hinge stage.  The 500 and 1000 count oysters were difficult to see at 5x on the inverted scope.  Couldn’t get the whole well in view and they were so dilute it was difficult to gauge viability etc.  The 10k wells looked ok, but maybe a little overloaded.  Saw some unfertilized eggs.  The 5000 plated embryos looked the best at all volumes.  Lots to see, but not overcrowded.  Example images 48 hrs:
I checked oysters after 96 hrs: thermometer read 26C. Many oysters still alive. Some veligers, but many still at D-hinge. I would say development being altered by lack of food and they got a little warm.   Still looking like a good number for 12-well plates.  Didn’t see a big difference between 2mL and 4 mL volumes.
Example image at 96 hrs:
Oysters were sacrificed with freshwater at 96 hrs
NEXT STEPS:
Repeat dye trials 2 and 3 to confirm results
Plate out the oysters from these dye trials at 5000 oyster/2 mL FSW to see if those that saw dye/rinsing are viable. Include negative controls: a) no dye and rinsed and 2) no dye/no rinse controls
Purchase morpholinos to repeat dye trial 2 and 3 with morpholino (v labeled dextran)
Consider how to objectively assay viability in this well based format…
