  In October and November a majority of effort has been allocated to identifying sequencing platforms and aquisiiton of biological material. This has involved several discussions with partners in terms of both laboratory and hatchery activity and time schedules. Characterization of the genome annotations have initiated such that gene information can be determined once libraries are constructed and sequenced. It is expected that biological material will be available in January, though this will be dependant on broodstock conditioning.
