  Initial testing on embryo handling and optimization of cell dissociation protocols was performed. Due to the lack of mature geoducks in the summer months, diploid Pacific oyster embryos were used for testing. Our objectives for testing included 1) identifying whether we could hold gametes for 12-24 hrs. prior to fertilization, 2) gaining a better understanding the developmental rate of embryos at 20C and 4C, and 3) optimizing the cell dissociation protocol for bivalve embryos. As a result of this testing we found that 1) unfertilized gametes could be held overnight at 4C with no effect on fertilization, 2) we could ‘suspend’ development of a particular cleavage stage by storing embryos at 4C, 3) identified an optimized protocol for obtaining single cell suspension that resulted in live, single cell suspension. A presentation on the project was given at the Pacific Coast Shellfish Growers Meeting in September and is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.9973361
