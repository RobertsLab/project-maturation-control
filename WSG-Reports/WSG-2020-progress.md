During this reporting period progress was severely limited by the COVID situation. Genomic annotation resources as well as informatic workflows were established. We were lucky in the sense that as part of a separate effort that started in 2019 we were able to makes some preliminary gains in the practical aspects of the objectives of this project. Specifically we have established an ability to gather gene expression for distinct cell populations in oyster embryos. This developmental time series will need to be repeated in order to capture a more complete picture of cell migration. Future efforts will also focus on optimizing delivery techniques of custom inhibitory molecules. We will need a no-cost extension to complete the work.
